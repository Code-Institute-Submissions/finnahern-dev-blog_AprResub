- ### Homepage listing all blog posts

All posts are listed newest first. The page features pagination so if there are more than 4 posts in the database it will create secondary pages with navigation links. Each post on the list features the title of the post, which is a link to individual post's view page, the publish date and time, the author and a truncated preview of the first 30 words.

- ### User dashboard

The user's dashboard can be reached from any page of the site by clicking on the username in the sidebar. It's a lot like the homepage except it can only be accessed once the user has logged in. It's list only features posts belonging to the currently signed in user. From here the user can change their password, create a new post, and they can view, edit or delete one of their existing posts. Like the home page, the dashboard also features pagination for more than 4 posts.
