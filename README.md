# Developer Blog

[Link to deployed site.](https://ms4-django-blog.herokuapp.com/)

A resubmission of my Django blog project. This document details the changes made to the project since the first submission. The unchanged, original Readme.md can be [found here](https://github.com/finnahern/dev-blog/blob/main/originalREADME.md).

The updated documentation below will detail changes made since the original version of the site.

## UX/Design

One of the bigger failures of the original submission was the poor user experience at the front end due to bad planning and time constraints leading to prioritising minimum functionality above everything else. I went back to the drawing board and created some simple wireframes of an updated version of the existing site (built using [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/)). This new design should be achievable with some simple Bootstrap formatting and make for a much more user friendly experience.
